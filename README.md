# ðŸš€ Fake Review Detector: AI-Powered Review Classification  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Fake reviews mislead consumers and harm businesses. This **Fake Review Detector** uses **Machine Learning & NLP** to classify reviews as **genuine (OR) or fake (FR)**.  

By leveraging **TF-IDF vectorization, CountVectorizer, and ensemble ML models**, the system identifies deceptive patterns in review texts.

## ðŸ”¥ Features  
âœ… **Machine Learning-Based Classification**  
- Implements **NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression**.  
- Uses **Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF** for feature extraction.  

ðŸ“Š **Text Processing & Feature Engineering**  
- Removes **stopwords, punctuation, and special characters**.  
- Extracts **top influential words** affecting classification.  

ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Evaluation**  
- Computes **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  
- Displays **Confusion Matrices & Model Comparisons**.  

ðŸ›  **Dataset Handling**  
- Loads **Preprocessed Fake Reviews Detection Dataset.csv**.  
- Analyzes **text length distribution** for data insights.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Takeaways**

- Best Performing Model: SVM (88.23%) achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score.

- NaÃ¯ve Bayes (85.15%) and Logistic Regression (86.48%) also showed strong performance.

- Decision Tree (73.75%) and KNN (70.52%) underperformed due to overfitting and sensitivity to feature space.

ðŸ”¹ **Most Influential Words**

Words most affecting classification:

small, littl, bought, much, problem, nt, good, even, great, love
